# G1-Project
# Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project implements an **Image Classifier** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with TensorFlow/Keras.  
The model is trained to classify images into multiple categories and includes features such as **Batch Normalization**, **Dropout Regularization**, and **Global Average Pooling** for improved performance and generalization.

## üöÄ Project Overview

- **Objective:** Train a CNN to classify images into predefined categories.
- **Framework:** TensorFlow / Keras
- **Model Type:** Deep Convolutional Neural Network (Custom)
- **Dataset:** Any image dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10, custom dataset)
- **Key Features:**
  - Multi-layer CNN with increasing filter complexity
  - Batch Normalization for stable learning
  - Dropout and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting
  - Global Average Pooling for lightweight classification
  - Trained model saved for reuse/inference
